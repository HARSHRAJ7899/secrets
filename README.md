The provided code is for a web application that allows users to register, log in, and share secrets anonymously. It uses Express.js for creating the server, Passport.js for authentication, Google OAuth for third-party login, and MongoDB for database storage. Let's break down the key components and the expected outcome of the project:

**1. Dependencies and Configuration:**
- The code begins by importing required packages and configuring the Express app.
- It sets up the view engine to use EJS templates and configures the app to use static files from the "public" directory.
- It uses the `body-parser` middleware to parse incoming request bodies.
- It configures sessions and Passport.js for authentication.

**2. Database Setup:**
- The code connects to a MongoDB database named "userDB" using Mongoose. This is where user data will be stored.

**3. User Schema and Plugins:**
- A Mongoose schema is defined for users, including fields like `email`, `password`, `googleId` (for OAuth), and `secret`.
- The schema is extended using `passportLocalMongoose` and `mongoose-findorcreate` plugins, which simplify user authentication and Google OAuth.

**4. Passport Configuration:**
- Passport.js is configured for local authentication using the `passportLocalMongoose` strategy.
- A Google OAuth 2.0 strategy is set up using the `passport-google-oauth20` package. This strategy allows users to log in using their Google accounts.

**5. Route Handling:**
- The code defines various routes for different functionalities of the web application.
- The home route ("/") renders a page where users can access authentication options.
- The "/auth/google" route initiates the Google OAuth authentication process.
- The "/auth/google/secrets" route handles the callback after successful Google OAuth authentication.
- The "/login" and "/register" routes render pages for users to log in or register.
- The "/secrets" route displays secrets shared by users who have them.
- The "/submit" route allows authenticated users to submit their own secrets.
- The "/logout" route logs out the user and redirects to the home page.
- The "/login" and "/register" routes handle user login and registration.

**6. Outcome of the Project:**
- Users can access the home page and choose to log in with their Google accounts using OAuth or register with a local username and password.
- After successful login or registration, users can access the "/secrets" page to view secrets shared by other users.
- Authenticated users can also access the "/submit" page to submit their own secrets.
- Secrets are associated with individual users and stored in the MongoDB database.
- Users can log out using the "/logout" route.

In summary, the outcome of the project is a web application that allows users to share and view secrets. It showcases a basic implementation of user authentication using both local (username and password) and Google OAuth methods. The application emphasizes the use of Express, Passport.js, Google OAuth, and MongoDB to create a functional and interactive web experience.
